Amity International Model United Nations Online Conference Management System-2015 
https://impranay.github.io/Amity-International-Model-United-Nations-2015/index.htm

This was the front-end pilot for the Amity International Model United Nations-Online Conference Management System (2015).
But unfortunately couldn't pass. The front-end was not possible without the help of Open Source CSS and fonts.
